# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi there! I'm Douglas Machado, a Control and Intelligent Systems Engineer passionate about Generative Artificial Intelligence and its applications in Industry 4.0 solutions. Originally from Porto Alegre, Brazil, I currently pursue PhD opportunities in this field, leveraging my background in Control and Automation Engineering from UFSC and Grenoble INP, Ense3.

With a solid foundation in collaborative robotics, IIoT & IoT, and product development, I thrive in environments where innovation meets real-world challenges. My hands-on experience as a Mechatronics Technician at SENAI Ney Damasceno Ferreira School and research at G-SCOP Laboratory and UFSC Robotics Laboratory have honed my skills in machine learning techniques and industrial automation.

Passionate about research, I've contributed to projects at UFSC Department of Automation and Systems and the Research Laboratory in Refrigeration and Thermophysics (POLO). My technical toolkit includes proficiency in C, Python, Pytorch, and SOLIDWORKS, among others, enabling me to tackle diverse projects with precision and creativity.

Fluent in Portuguese, French, and English, I perform effectively in multicultural settings and enjoy collaborating with teams worldwide to achieve meaningful results. Whether it's designing smart maintenance strategies or delving into the depths of Generative AI, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible.
